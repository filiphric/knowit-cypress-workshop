# Chaining & retry-ability

## Chaining
- every command passes information onto another
- commands have a parent/child relationship, and some behave differently depending on whether they are in parent position or child
- you can see what each command returns by looking into "Yielded" value inside the browser console

## Retry-ability
- this is one of the core concepts in Cypress. You might know this as "fluent-wait" if you are coming from Selenium
- by default, Cypress waits for 4000 milliseconds, but this can be adjusted in the command, test, or globally in `cypress.json` file
- `.should()` command will make the previous command retry, so think about that when you are testing something that might still render while your test is running
